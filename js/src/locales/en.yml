    The main resource for accessing neural networks is ⚡️ (energy).
    This is a universal resource for all bot functionality.

    Each neural network consumes a different amount of ⚡️.
    The amount of ⚡️ spent depends on the length of the dialog history, neural network models, and the volume of your questions and responses from the neural network.
    To save, use the command - /clear, to avoid overflowing the dialog history and increasing ⚡️ (energy) consumption! 
    It is recommended to clear the context before starting a discussion on a new topic. Also if the selected model started refusing help.
